Hi there! I'm Abby Fang (Fang Jingyi), a Computer Science and Material Science student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. Iâ€™m passionate about machine learning, LLMs, and applying AI in science. 

Iâ€™m currently actively seeking **Software Development Engineer (SDE)** and **Machine Learning Engineer (MLE)** positions. **Feel free to explore my website, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!**

Research Experiences
======
I was supervised by Prof. [Yanlin Huang](https://chemistry.suda.edu.cn/30/f0/c31986a405744/page.htm) from College of Material Science and Chemistry, Chemical Engineering of Soochow University. And now I'm being supervised by Prof. [Chris Bartel](https://cse.umn.edu/cems/chris-bartel) of College of Science and Engineering of University of Minnesota Twin Cities and incoming Prof. [Nathan Szymanski](https://bartel.cems.umn.edu/people/group-members). 
My research interests now lie in **large language model (LLM) agents**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **AI for science**, and **machine learning**. I'm also open to discuss with any other topics in the field of AI!
