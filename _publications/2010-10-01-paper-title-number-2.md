In this work, we explored the photoluminescence and structural characteristics of Eu³⁺-doped perovskite phosphors with cation deficiency.

Our study provides a comparative analysis of the spectral features and reveals significant improvement in luminescent efficiency under specific doping conditions. These findings contribute to the development of advanced optical materials for display and lighting technologies.
